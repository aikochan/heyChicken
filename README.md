heyChicken
==========

heyChicken is a chicken coop automation project that monitors temperature, whether the chickens are all on the roost bar and automate closing the door to the nest box.

Hardware Used
  - Arduino (Uno)
  - WiFi shield
  - DS18B20 One-wire temperature sensor(s) (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11050)
  - Flexiforce Pressure sensor (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8685)




*NOTE*: The OneWire library is a git submodule. After checking out the heyChicken project, you will need to initialize and and update the submodule. See this page: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#Cloning-a-Project-with-Submodules

Now, add the OneWire library to Arduino. (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
